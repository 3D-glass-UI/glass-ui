## Description
#### This is an early draft of the 3D glass UI library.

This project is set up as a design system prototyping playground. You can easily configure the design tokens and instantly see the results applied to the [demo site](https://3d-glass-ui.com/).


<div align="center" width="100%">
  <img src="src/assets/homeImg/glass-details_1024x1236.jpg" width="600">
</div>

### Features
* Customizable design tokens and composable styling classes. *For glass that reflects your branding.*
* Fluid typography and sizing. *For elements that scale with viewport width.*
* Container queries. *For truly responsive components.*

### Build with
* HTML
* CSS (SCSS)
* Vanilla JS

### Browser compatibility
#### All the CSS used is supported by the latest desktop and mobile versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.
If you require legacy browser support please make sure to test! The goal of this project was to create next-gen glassmorphism, therefore backwards compatibility was not a top priority.
