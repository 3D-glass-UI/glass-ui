            <br>
            I set out to mimic the Apple Vision Pro spatial UI to see if it was possible and to challenge myself to play with all the shiny new CSS properties. I did not do it for monetary gain or to encourage people to copy other’s work and pass it off as their own. Not only because it would potentially be ethically/legally dubious but also because it would make for an extremely dull digital landscape.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            That is why I designed the 3d glass UI library with ease of customization at its core.  I hope you will have fun being creative while making it your own!

        <div class="grid gap-3xs">
          <h3 class="title-thin-md">But why the Vision Pro's UI?</h3>
          <p class="">
            Because it displays an impressive level of craftsmanship and creativity that I seldom encounter in this category. Generally, UI is a means to an end. Select a primary and secondary color, add a font, and decide how round the corners should be. Done! Now move on to the real work. Fair enough, UI is there to enable the user to access the functionality of a thing, and not a thing in and of itself. Be that as it may, I can’t help but swoon in the presence of great beauty and innovation.

          <h3 class="title-thin-md">Why not create a unique glass look instead?</h3>
          <p class="">
            I did, several actually. But to be used in other projects. You don't them here because it’s tricky to objectively judge the success of a set of techniques via a unique creation. That’s because there is nothing concrete to compare the results to. Any artifact in the end product could be a mistake, a limitation, or a design decision.

      <img src="/assets/homeImg/Project-Looking-Glass.png"/>

      <p class="glass-fill-xdark first-line-bold space-wide">Surprisingly (at least to me), glassmorphism dates back to the early years of this millennium. Take Project Looking Glass, for example. Developed in 2003, this was an entire desktop environment designed to resemble thick glass slabs. Usable? Not so much. Impressive? Absolutely. Hideya Kawahara was designing two full decades ahead of his time. Available compute power and rendering resources be damned!
      </p>

      <img src="/assets/homeImg/bevel.png"/ class="">

      <p class="glass-fill-xdark space-wide">Over the course of those two decades, glassmorphism has ridden the rollercoaster of popularity.  From the moderate heights of Apple's iOS 7 to the irredeemable depths of Windows Vista, this design trend has seen it all. Now, with the Apple Vision Pro, hitting the scene, I predict a new peak for glassmorphism on our digital horizons.</p>

        <div class="glass-fill-xdark section__end">
        <p class="space-wide first-line-bold">Take a close look at Vision Pro’s UI, and you'll notice it's not your run-of-the-mill glassmorphism. Yet, at first glance, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what sets it apart. Much like the rest of everything Apple ever does, it just seems subliminally superior and more polished. Consequently, I spent a rather not-so-insignificant amount of time capturing screenshots from the Vision Pro keynote and wishing that yelling "enhance!" at my computer would actually yield results.
        Here are my findings:

        <p>The above output is fairly representative of the glassmorphism tutorials currently available online. Not a noise texture or glistening specular highlight in sight. The meager blur radius compromises legibility, while the bright white outline falls lightyears short of the dimensionality it is meant to depict.</p>
        
        <p>But fear not! We can do better. Keep reading, and I'll show you how.</p>
