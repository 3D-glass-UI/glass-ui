      <!-- <p class=" first-line-bold space-wide glass-tint-xdark">After picking my jaw up off the floor post-Apple Vision Pro keynote, I was struck with the inescapable urge to find out if the 3D glass UI could be built using CSS. The answer wasn't obvious. After all, the UI is meant to live on a unique piece of hardware, running on a custom operating system. For all I knew, the whole R1 chip might just be there to run real-time ray tracing for a UI that’s constructed from actual 3D meshes. I jest, but only a little.

      </div>

      <p class="glass-fill-xdark first-line-bold space-wide">Surprisingly (at least to me), glassmorphism dates back to the early years of this millennium. Take Project Looking Glass, for example. Developed in 2003, this was an entire desktop environment designed to resemble thick glass slabs. Usable? Not so much. Impressive? Absolutely. Hideya Kawahara was designing two full decades ahead of his time. Available compute power and rendering resources be damned!
      </p>

      <p class="glass-fill-xdark space-wide">Over the course of those two decades, glassmorphism has ridden the rollercoaster of popularity.  From the moderate heights of Apple's iOS 7 to the irredeemable depths of Windows Vista, this design trend has seen it all. Now, with the Apple Vision Pro, hitting the scene, I predict a new peak for glassmorphism on our digital horizons.</p>

        <p class="space-wide first-line-bold">Take a close look at Vision Pro’s UI, and you'll notice it's not your run-of-the-mill glassmorphism. Yet, at first glance, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what sets it apart. Much like the rest of everything Apple ever does, it just seems subliminally superior and more polished. Consequently, I spent a rather not-so-insignificant amount of time capturing screenshots from the Vision Pro keynote and wishing that yelling "enhance!" at my computer would actually yield results.
        Here are my findings:

        <p>The above output is fairly representative of the glassmorphism tutorials currently available online. Not a noise texture or glistening specular highlight in sight. The meager blur radius compromises legibility, while the bright white outline falls lightyears short of the dimensionality it is meant to depict.</p>
        
        <p>But fear not! We can do better. Keep reading, and I'll show you how.</p>
