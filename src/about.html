            <br>
            I set out to mimic the Apple Vision Pro spatial UI to see if it was possible and to challenge myself to play with all the shiny new CSS properties. I did not do it for monetary gain or to encourage people to copy other’s work and pass it off as their own. Not only because it would potentially be ethically/legally dubious but also because it would make for an extremely dull digital landscape.

          <p class="">
            That is why I designed the 3d glass UI library with ease of customization at its core.  I hope you will have fun being creative while making it your own!

        <div class="grid gap-3xs">
          <h3 class="title-thin-md">But why the Vision Pro's UI?</h3>
          <p class="">
            Because it displays an impressive level of craftsmanship and creativity that I seldom encounter in this category. Generally, UI is a means to an end. Select a primary and secondary color, add a font, and decide how round the corners should be. Done! Now move on to the real work. Fair enough, UI is there to enable the user to access the functionality of a thing, and not a thing in and of itself. Be that as it may, I can’t help but swoon in the presence of great beauty and innovation.

        <div class="grid gap-3xs">
          <h3 class="title-thin-md">Why not create a unique glass look instead?</h3>
          <p class="">
            I did, several actually. But to be used in other projects. You don't them here because it’s tricky to objectively judge the success of a set of techniques via a unique creation. That’s because there is nothing concrete to compare the results to. Any artifact in the end product could be a mistake, a limitation, or a design decision.
